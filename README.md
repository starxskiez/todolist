# To-do List

**WARNING: This game contains some unicode, so some of the text may appear as ï¿½ or something similar.**

## How it Works
First, you type in whatever you like in the "Type something here..." prompt. The maximum characters is 50. Then click the plus icon and the text you type in will appear. Also, by clicking on the "x", you can delete an item in your to-do list. Finally, by clicking on an item on your to-do list (Don't click on the "x"), you can check it off.
